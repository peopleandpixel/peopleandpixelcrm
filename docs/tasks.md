17. [ ] Sorting, filtering, and pagination standardization
   - [ ] Create a unified Pagination object and helpers for building sort/filter links
   - [ ] Normalize allowed sort keys per entity to prevent invalid input

18. [ ] Performance and caching
   - [ ] Profile list/detail pages; remove N+1 patterns
   - [ ] Add HTTP caching headers (ETag/Last-Modified) for list pages where safe
   - [ ] Cache computed lists and i18n dictionaries per request
